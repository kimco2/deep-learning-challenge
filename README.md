# Neural network classification model

## **Overview**
 A neural network was used to develop a classification tool for the non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup to help it select applicants for funding who have the greatest chance of success.
 
Aspects to note:
 - Target and feature variables identified
 - Unnecessary columns removed
 - Rare categorical variables handled
 - Data split into appropriate training and testing sets
 - Data normalised using a StandardScaler fitted to the training data
 - Neural network model created, trained, evaluated and optimised
 - Report written to provide a comprehensive overview of the outcome

***Folder structure***


The main folder contains:<br/>
-**AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb** - notebook for the initial model
-**AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_1.ipynb** - notebook for the 1st optimisation attempt<br/>
-**AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_2.ipynb** - notebook for the 2nd optimisation attempt <br/>
-**AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_3.ipynb** - notebook for the 3rd optimisation attempt<br/>
-**Neural_network_report.pdf** - comprehensive overview of the outcome

The folder  **HDF5_files** contains the HDF5 files for the original model and the three attempts to optimise it.

The folder  **model_weights** contains the HDF5 files saved at intervals of every 5 epochs for the original model and the three attempts to optimise it.

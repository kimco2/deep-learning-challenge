# Neural network classification model

### **Overview**
 A neural network model was used to develop a classification tool for the non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup to help it select funding applicants that have the greatest chance of success.

### **Aspects covered**
- Identifying target and feature variables
- Transforming data to remove unnecessary columns and handle rare categorical variables
- Splitting data into appropriate training and testing sets
- Normalising data using StandardScaler fitted to the training data
- Creating, training, evaluating and optimising a neural network
- Writing a report to provide a comprehensive overview of the outcome

### **Folder structure**
The main folder contains:
- *AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb* - notebook for the initial model
 - *AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_1.ipynb* - notebook for the 1st optimisation attempt
 - *AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_2.ipynb* - notebook for the 2nd optimisation attempt
 - *AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_3.ipynb* - notebook for the 3rd optimisation attempt
 - *Neural_network_report.pdf* - comprehensive overview of the outcome

The folder  *HDF5_files* contains the HDF5 files for the original model and the three attempts to optimise it.

The folder  *model_weights* contains the HDF5 files saved at intervals of every 5 epochs for the original model and the three attempts to optimise it.

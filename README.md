# deep-learning-challenge

## Hi, this is the repository for Module 21 deep learning challenge.

-The main folder contains:
- **AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb** - notebook for the initial model
- **AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_1.ipynb** - notebook for the first optimisation attempt 
- **AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_2.ipynb** - notebook for the second optimisation attempt 
- **AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation_3.ipynb** - notebook for the third optimisation attempt 
- **Module_21_deep_learning_report.pdf** - report on the analysis and findings from the models.

-The folder called **HDF5_files** contains the HDF5 files for the original model and the three attempts to optimise it.

-The folder called **model_weights** contains the HDF5 files saved at intervals of every 5 epochs for the original model and the three attempts to optimise it.

Thanks <br/>
Kim
